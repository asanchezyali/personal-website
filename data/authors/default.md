Hello, my name is Alejandro Sanchez Yalí and I am passionate about technology and programming. Since I was a child, I have always been fascinated with understanding how things work and how new things can be created through programming.

For me, programming is more than just a job or a hobby, it is a way of expression and making my ideas a reality. As a mathematician and programmer, I have had the opportunity to work on interesting and challenging projects, and have learned many new things along the way.

My motto is "If I code, then I exist," because I believe that through programming I can do incredible things and shape my world.

I love learning new technologies and constantly improving my skills, and enjoy sharing my knowledge and passion for technology through writing. Currently, I write about technology and computer science on my personal blog and on various websites, and I hope to continue exploring new topics and sharing my ideas with others.

I hope you enjoyed getting to know me a little more. If you want to know more about me, you can follow me on my social media or visit my LinkedIn profile. See you soon!
