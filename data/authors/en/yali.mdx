Hello, I'm Alejandro. I work in software development and have a background in mathematics.

I enjoy exploring the intersection between programming and mathematics, always looking for ways to apply abstract concepts to practical problems. I've worked on various projects ranging from web applications to machine learning algorithms.

In this blog, I share my thoughts on technology, mathematics, and the challenges I encounter in my day-to-day life as a programmer. I'm not an expert in everything, but I like to learn and share what I discover along the way.

If you're interested in exchanging ideas about programming, mathematics, or any related topic, feel free to connect,
follow me on my social media, or visit my LinkedIn profile. See you soon!
