summary: 'A division algorithm is a process that divides one number (called the dividend) by another number (called the divisor) and obtains the quotient and remainder of the division. A division algorithm can be implemented in Python using a while loop and subtracting the divisor from the dividend in each iteration. Knowing how a division algorithm works and how to implement it on our own is useful for understanding better how divisions work and can be useful in situations where we cannot use predefined libraries or functions.'

Division is a basic mathematical operation that we often use in our daily lives. Although we can easily perform divisions using predefined functions or libraries, it is important to know how a division algorithm works and how to implement it on our own.

In mathematics the division algorithm is stated as follows:

<div className="italic text-gray-50 px-4 text-sm">Given two integers $a$ and $b$, with $b\neq 0$, we can find an integer $q$ and an integer $r$ such that $a = bq + r$ and $0 \leq r <|b|$. The integer $q$ is called the quotient and the integer $r$ is called the remainder of the division of $a$ by $b$. In the case where $b$ is negative, the quotient $q$ is negative and the remainder $r$ is positive.</div>

The above theorem defines a way to calculate the quotient and remainder of a division, but it does not seem to be an algorithm itself. However, its mathematical approach can be useful in developing an efficient division algorithm. The idea is to apply the concepts of the theorem to create a systematic and repetitive process that allows dividing two numbers and obtaining the desired result. In this way, we can use logic and mathematics to solve practical problems and apply theory in practice.

# Explanation of the division algorithm for integers

Before implementing the algorithm, let's see how division is performed manually, also considering negative numbers. We'll use the example of dividing 17 by 5, and then explain how to handle negative cases.

## Positive case: 17 ÷ 5

1. We initialize the dividend with 17, the divisor with 5, the quotient at 0, and the remainder equal to the dividend (17).

2. We check if the absolute value of the remainder is greater than or equal to the absolute value of the divisor. Since |17| ≥ |5|, we enter the cycle.

3. We subtract the absolute value of the divisor from the absolute value of the remainder: 17 - 5 = 12.

4. We increase the absolute value of the quotient by 1: 0 + 1 = 1.

5. We repeat steps 3 and 4 until the absolute value of the remainder is less than that of the divisor.

6. At the end, the absolute value of the quotient is 3 and that of the remainder is 2.

Iteration table:

| Iteration | Dividend | Divisor | Quotient | Remainder |
| --------- | -------- | ------- | -------- | --------- |
| 1         | 17       | 5       | 0        | 17        |
| 2         | 17       | 5       | 1        | 12        |
| 3         | 17       | 5       | 2        | 7         |
| 4         | 17       | 5       | 3        | 2         |

## Handling negative cases

To handle negative numbers, we follow these additional steps:

1. At the beginning, we determine the sign of the result:

   - If the dividend and divisor have the same sign, the result is positive.
   - If they have different signs, the result is negative.

2. We work with absolute values during the division.

3. At the end, we adjust the sign of the quotient as determined in step 1.

4. The sign of the remainder is always the same as that of the original dividend.

## Examples with negative numbers

### Case 1: -17 ÷ 5

- Sign of the result: Negative (different signs)
- Absolute dividend: 17, Absolute divisor: 5
- Division process same as in the positive case
- Result: Quotient = -3, Remainder = -2

### Case 2: 17 ÷ -5

- Sign of the result: Negative (different signs)
- Absolute dividend: 17, Absolute divisor: 5
- Division process same as in the positive case
- Result: Quotient = -3, Remainder = 2

### Case 3: -17 ÷ -5

- Sign of the result: Positive (both negative)
- Absolute dividend: 17, Absolute divisor: 5
- Division process same as in the positive case
- Result: Quotient = 3, Remainder = -2

## Special case: Dividend less than divisor

If the absolute value of the dividend is less than that of the divisor, the quotient is 0 and the remainder is equal to the dividend. For example:

- 3 ÷ 5 = Quotient: 0, Remainder: 3
- -3 ÷ 5 = Quotient: 0, Remainder: -3
- 3 ÷ -5 = Quotient: 0, Remainder: 3
- -3 ÷ -5 = Quotient: 0, Remainder: -3

# Implementation of the division algorithm in Python

Next, we present a pseudocode that describes the division algorithm for integers, including the handling of negative
numbers.

</PseudoCodeLine>
<PseudoCodeLine showNumber={false} indent={0}>
$\text{\textbf{Salida:} } (\text{cociente}, \text{residuo})$
</PseudoCodeLine>
</PseudoCode>

An example of code in Python that implements the above process is as follows:

```python showLineNumbers
def division(dividend, divisor):
    if divisor == 0:
        raise ValueError("Divisor cannot be zero")

    # Determine the sign of the result more explicitly
    if (dividend >= 0 and divisor > 0) or (dividend <= 0 and divisor < 0):
        sign = 1
    else:
        sign = -1

    # Work with absolute values
    dividend = abs(dividend)
    divisor = abs(divisor)

    quotient = 0
    remainder = dividend

    while remainder >= divisor:
        remainder -= divisor
        quotient += 1

    # Adjust the sign of the quotient and remainder
    quotient *= sign
    remainder *= -1 if dividend < 0 else 1

    return quotient, remainder

# Test the algorithm
dividend = int(input("Enter the dividend: "))
divisor = int(input("Enter the divisor: "))
quotient, remainder = division(dividend, divisor)
print("Quotient:", quotient)
print("Remainder:", remainder)
```

This code performs the division of two numbers entered by the user. First, the variables `quotient` y `remainder`, are defined, and the value of the dividend is assigned to `remainder`. hen, a `while` loop is used that runs while `remainder` is greater than or equal to `divisor`. EOn each iteration, `divisor` is subtracted from `remainder` and the value of `quotient` s increased by one. Finally, the values of `quotient` and `remainder` are returned as the result of the `division()` function.

When this code is executed and two numbers are provided as input, we will obtain the quotient and the remainder of the division. For example, if we divide $15$ by $3$, the result would be a quotient of $5$ and a remainder of $0$. If we divide $17$ by $3$, the result would be a quotient of $5$ and a remainder of $2$.

It is important to note that the division algorithm we have implemented is a basic and effective way of performing divisions, but there are other more advanced and efficient ways. However, this example is useful for understanding the basic concepts behind division and how to apply them in practice with a programming language.

I hope this helps you understand how a division algorithm works and how to implement it in Python without using libraries. If you have any additional questions, feel free to ask.
