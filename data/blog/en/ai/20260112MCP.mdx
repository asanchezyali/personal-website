A practical guide to implementing Anthropic's Model Context Protocol for scalable AI integrations using FastAPI and
Domain-Driven Design principles.

## The problem: brilliant AI models, isolated data

Large Language Models (LLMs) are remarkable reasoners and generators of human-like text, until you ask them to work with
your current data of your work. A model might understand complex business logic, debug intricate code, and explain
quantum physics, but it struggles to provide accurate answers when the context is outside its training data. For
example, it can't access your company's internal documents, databases, or proprietary knowledge bases.

This isn't a limitation of intelligence; it's a limitation of context. LLMs can only work with the information they have
been trained on, which is often static and outdated.

The traditional approach to solving this problem has been to fine-tune models on specific datasets or to use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. However, these methods can be resource-intensive, time-consuming, and may not
always yield the desired results. Moreover, they often require significant engineering effort to integrate with existing
systems. Anthropic call the «M x N integration problem». If you have M different AI applications and N different data
sources, you end up Building «M x N» custom integrations. Every new AI model required new connectors . Every new data
source multiplies the maintenance burden.

The result? Fragmented codebases, duplicated effort, and AI systems that remain frustratingly disconnected from the data
that matters most.

## Model Context Protocol - MCP

Released by Anthropic in November 2024, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that acts as a universal
interface between AI models and external systems. You can think of MCP like USB-C for AI applications. Just a USB-C
provides a standardized way to connect devices to various perripherals, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI
models to different data sources and tools through a common API.

## What MCP actually is?

MCP is not a library or framework, it;s a protocol specification. It defines:

- How AI clients discover available tools and resources.
- How requests and responses are structured (JSON-RPC 2.0).
- How authentication and authorization work.
- How to maintain context across multiple interactions.

The key insight is simple: instead of «M x N» custom integrations, you build «M + N» components. Each AI application
implements the MCP client protocol once. Everything connects.\
