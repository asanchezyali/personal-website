    <title>Neural networks represented as DAGs of parameterized computational programs</title>
    <link>https://asanchezyali.com/blog/en/differentiable-programming/20240923DifferentiablePrograms</link>
    <description>Neural networks can be viewed as algorithms with adjustable parameters, optimized through machine learning. This approach allows us to address them from a broader mathematical and computational perspective. In this article, we will explore how to represent these algorithms as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).</description>
